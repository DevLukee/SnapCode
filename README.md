# SnapCode
Snapcode offers a quick and snappy solution for copying code. This software can be used for any programming language and doesn't nessasairly have to be for coding, BUT
I will mainly create & update this project for the use of programming. 

# How to use
1. Run the application.
2. Screenshot the code you'd like to copy.
3. All the code in the screenshot will now be copied to your clipboard for your usage.
